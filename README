Breeze is a library for numerical processing, machine learning, and natural language processing.
It's primary focus is on being generic, clean, and powerful without sacrificing (much) efficiency.

The library currently consists of several parts: 

* breeze-math: Linear algebra and numerics routines
* breeze-stats: Probability distributions and basic statistics
* breeze-process: Libraries for managing datasets and job pipelines.
* breeze-learn: Machine Learning and Optimization.

Possible future releases:
* breeze-viz: Vizualization and plotting
* breeze-parse: A statistical parsing library
* breeze-fst: Finite state toolkit

Breeze is the merger of the ScalaNLP and Scalala projects, because 
one of the original maintainers is unable to continue development.
The Scalala parts are largely rewritten.
